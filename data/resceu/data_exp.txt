Description of the data files in rsv_data.Rda

A) DEMOGRAPHIC DATA
- ageGroupBoundary, vector of numbers showing the lower limit of the age groups considered in the model.
- ageGroupNumber, number of age groups considered in the model.
- numberDailyLiveBirths, daily number of live births in England and Wales.
- population, population of England and Wales.   
- contactMatrixPhy, ageGroupNumber x ageGroupNumber matrix of daily physical contacts.
- contactMatrixCon, ageGroupNumber x ageGroupNumber matrix of daily conversational contacts.

B) OBSERVATION DATA
- observationalData, dataframe where the columns are the age groups considered, rows are the number of weeks considered, and the entries are the number of weekly positive sample per age group. This data is different to the one used in the paper.

C) PARAMETER DATA
- fit.par, data frame with three columns, namesOfParameters (symbol fo the parameters), lowerParSupport, (lower boundary for each parameter), and upperParSupport (upper boundary for each parameter). 
- priorDistSample, list of sampling prior distribution functions for the fitted parameters.
- priorDistDensity, list of density prior distribution functions for the fitted parameters.
- priorDistPar1, first parameter associated with each prior distribution.
- priorDistPar2, second parameter associated with each prior distribution.
